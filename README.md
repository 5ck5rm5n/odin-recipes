# Odin Recipes

Hello everyone!

I'm excited to share my first project: **Odin Recipes**. In this project, I showcase everything I've learned so far in The Odin Project HTML foundations.

## What I Learned

Here’s a summary of the HTML elements and techniques I used in this project:

- I used heading elements (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to structure content by importance.
- Paragraphs were added using the `<p>` tag to group and format text.
- For emphasis, I used `<em>` or `<i>` to italicize important words.
- To make text bold, I used `<strong>` and its alternative `<b>`.
- I connected multiple pages using the `<a>` anchor tag with the `href` attribute for navigation.
- I included `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links for better **security and privacy**.
- Images were inserted using the `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute pointing to either local or external image sources.
- For lists:
  - I used `<ul>` for unordered lists and `<ol>` for ordered lists.
  - Each list item was wrapped in an `<li>` tag.
- I learned to quickly generate the basic HTML boilerplate using the `!` shortcut in most editors.

## Project Content

This project features **my favorite Filipino dishes**, complete with recipes and brief descriptions. You’ll find a list of ingredients and instructions so you can try cooking them yourself — perfect for family gatherings or special occasions!
