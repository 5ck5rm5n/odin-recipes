# odin-recipes

Hello everyone!

I'm excited to share my first project: "Odin's Recipe". In this project, I showcase what I've learned so far in The Odin Project HTML foundations.

## What I Learned

Here's the summary of HTML elements and techniques I used in this project:

- First I added a heading with the element <h1> to <h6> to structure content by importance.
- Also I added a paragraph with element <p></p> wrapped the content within to group and format.
- And for the emphasis can be <em> or alternative <i> to italicized the important text.
- Bold element wrapped the context with the help of element <strong></strong> and alternative element to make the context bold <b></b>.
- To make all the pages within the website connected i used the element <a> what we called anchor tag and it is also a void element followed with 'src=' with the directory of the pages.
- I added 'rel=' and 'noopener' for security purposes and also 'noreferrer'.
- We can also add a link by another website outside our system through anchor tag.
- For the image that display on the screen or within each pages, I used <img> tag with 'src=' with the directory of the image or link if the image is from outside the system.
- For listing of the items I used <ul></ul> for unordered listing and <ol></ol> for ordered list wrapped within is <li><li> element for listing.
- I learned to quickly generate the basic HTML boilerplate using the '!' shortcut in most editors.
