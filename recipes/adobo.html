    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Adobo is a popular Filipino dish made with meat, usually chicken or pork, marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and spices, then simmered until tender. It's known for its savory and tangy flavor.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 kg chicken or pork, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine vinegar, soy sauce, minced garlic, bay leaves, black peppercorns, and sugar (if using). Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken or pork pieces to the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight for better flavor.</li>
        <li>Heat cooking oil in a large pot over medium heat. Remove the meat from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and brown the meat on all sides.</li>
        <li>Pour the reserved marinade into the pot with the browned meat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer for about 30-40 minutes or until the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Adjust seasoning with salt if needed. If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can remove the lid and let it simmer uncovered for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with steamed rice.</li>
