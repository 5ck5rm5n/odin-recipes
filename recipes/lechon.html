    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lechon is a traditional Filipino dish that features a whole roasted pig, known for its crispy skin and tender meat. It is often served during special occasions and celebrations, making it a centerpiece of Filipino feasts. The pig is marinated with a blend of spices and herbs, then cooked over an open flame or in an oven until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Lechon is typically served with a dipping sauce made from liver sauce or vinegar, and it is enjoyed with steamed rice. The dish is not only a culinary delight but also a symbol of Filipino hospitality and culture.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole pig (about 20-30 kg)</li>
        <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup calamansi juice (or lemon juice)</li>
        <li>1 cup garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup lemongrass, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>Banana leaves (for wrapping)</li>
        <li>Cooking oil (for basting)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the pig thoroughly and remove any hair. Pat it dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, vinegar, calamansi juice, minced garlic, chopped onion, chopped lemongrass, black peppercorns, salt, and sugar to create a marinade.</li>
        <li>Rub the marinade all over the pig, making sure to get it into the cavity and under the skin. Let it marinate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven or prepare a charcoal pit for roasting. If using an oven, preheat it       to 180째C (350째F).</li>
        <li>Wrap the pig in banana leaves to keep it moist during cooking. If using a charcoal pit, place the pig on a spit and secure it properly.</li>
        <li>Roast the pig for about 4-6 hours, basting it with cooking oil every 30 minutes to achieve a crispy skin. If using an oven, place the wrapped pig on a roasting rack and cook for the same amount of time, turning it occasionally for even cooking.</li>
        <li>Check the internal temperature of the pig; it should reach at least 75째C (165째F) to ensure it is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove the pig from the oven or pit and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes before carving.</li>
        <li>Serve the lechon with liver sauce or vinegar on the side, along with steamed rice and your favorite side dishes.</li>
